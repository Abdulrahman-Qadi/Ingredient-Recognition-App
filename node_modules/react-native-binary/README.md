_CLI commands to reuse React Native binaries_

## Installation

```
yarn add react-native-binary --dev
```

Create or edit your `react-native.config.js` to look like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  commands: require('react-native-binary'),
};
```

## Usage

### `binary-hash` command

Calculates a hash for which the project is expected to be producing identical native binary builds. This is useful for optimizing build pipelines to detect when a binary can be reused.

```
npx react-native binary-hash --platform ios --folders patches
```
