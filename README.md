# MyReciPal Mobile App

MyReciPal is a mobile application that leverages Deep Learning to predict ingredients from an image and generate corresponding recipes. The application is built using React Native and Expo, and it uses TensorFlow.js and Keras for the Machine Learning part.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this application locally, you need to have Node.js, npm (Node Package Manager), and Expo CLI installed on your system. If you don't have Node.js and npm, you can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). After installing Node.js and npm, you can install Expo CLI using the following command:
